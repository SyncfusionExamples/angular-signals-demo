# SignalDemo

This repository contains a sample application designed to demonstrate the usage of Angular Signals in a real-world scenario. By building a mini e-commerce application, we explore the power of reactive programming and how Signals can simplify state management in Angular.

## Concepts Covered

- **Introduction to Signals**: Learn the basics of Signals and their role in reactive programming.
- **State Updates**: Implement Signals for seamless and efficient state changes.
- **Reactive Dependencies**: Demonstrate how dependent computations update automatically.
- **Optimized UI Rendering**: Use Signals to improve performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

## Why Signals?
Angular Signals offer a clean and powerful way to manage application state and reactivity. Unlike traditional observables or services, Signals focus on:

- Declarative State Updates
- Automatic Dependency Tracking
- Performance Optimization
  
This application showcases how to leverage these benefits in a real-world application.
